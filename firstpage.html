<p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and typesetting industry. 
<em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it 
to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with <strong><em>desktop publishing software</em></strong> like 
      Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
